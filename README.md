# 🛡️ Cyber Attack Detection using CNN

A Machine Learning project that leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to identify and classify the type of **cyber attack** based on raw or preprocessed **network traffic data**.

---

## 📌 About

This project uses a deep learning-based approach to perform **network intrusion detection**. By analyzing patterns in network traffic (such as packet sizes, durations, and flags), the model can distinguish between normal behavior and various types of cyber attacks (e.g., DoS, DDoS, Port Scans, etc.).
